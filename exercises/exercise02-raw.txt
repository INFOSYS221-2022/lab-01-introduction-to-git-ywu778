Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses a very basic syntax to describe documents. 
The Markdown syntax is appealing to users as it can easily be read almost as easily in its 
plain-text form as it can be when it is rendered. This makes it an ideal format to use for 
lightweight documentation tasks that might be consumed through a web browser or through a text
editor. 

Basic formatting in markdown is done through surrounding works with symbols. With this, we can 
create effects like italicized and bolded text - and can even show content with a monospaced font.

Titles and headings in markdown can be created in a couple of ways. By underlining text with 
certain characters you are able to generate

#Large titles

and 

Smaller titles
=====


This is fairly useful, but you often wish to generate more levels of heading, so you are also
able to dictate heading lines by prepending hash-marks to the line to produce

##Huge

Large

Medium

and 

Small

Markdown allows us to generate numbered lists by following these steps

Putting each entry on a new line
Prepending a number followed by a period to each line
Observing the results
